## 1. Mission Statement

### 1.1 Platform Positioning

The Single-Cell Intelligence Agent is one of **11 intelligence agents** in the HCLS AI Factory, a three-engine precision medicine platform (Genomics, RAG/Chat, Drug Discovery) running on NVIDIA DGX Spark. It occupies the single-cell transcriptomics niche, providing cellular-resolution analysis that complements bulk genomic data from the Genomics Engine.

**All 11 HCLS AI Factory Intelligence Agents:**

| # | Agent | Port | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Biomarker Intelligence | :8529 | Biomarker discovery and stratification |
| 2 | Oncology Intelligence | :8527/:8528 | Cancer genomics and treatment |
| 3 | CAR-T Intelligence | -- | CAR-T cell therapy development |
| 4 | Imaging Intelligence | :8524 | Medical imaging AI |
| 5 | Autoimmune Intelligence | -- | Autoimmune disease genomics |
| 6 | Pharmacogenomics Intelligence | :8107 | Drug metabolism and dosing |
| 7 | Clinical Trial Intelligence | :8538 | Trial design and matching |
| 8 | Rare Disease Diagnostic | :8134 | Rare disease diagnosis |
| 9 | **Single-Cell Intelligence** | **:8540** | **Single-cell transcriptomics (this agent)** |
| 10 | Cardiology Intelligence | :8126 | Cardiac genetics |
| 11 | Neurology Intelligence | -- | Neurological genetics |

### 1.2 Mission

The Single-Cell Intelligence Agent delivers RAG-powered clinical decision support at single-cell resolution, transforming raw transcriptomic data into clinically actionable insights for oncology, immunology, and cell therapy teams. It bridges the gap between single-cell research output and bedside treatment decisions by combining curated domain knowledge, vector-based evidence retrieval, and LLM-powered synthesis.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Resolution Gap

Precision medicine has advanced from tissue-level to gene-level analysis, but clinical decisions still rely on bulk-averaged measurements that mask critical cellular heterogeneity. A tumor biopsy reporting "PD-L1 positive" may contain 30% immune-hot niches and 70% immune-cold desert -- information invisible at bulk resolution but decisive for immunotherapy selection.

### 2.2 The Interpretation Bottleneck

Single-cell RNA-seq generates datasets with 10,000-500,000 cells, each expressing 20,000+ genes. A trained bioinformatician requires 2-4 weeks to fully annotate, profile, and interpret a single dataset. Clinical turnaround expectations are 24-72 hours.

### 2.3 The Knowledge Integration Challenge

Actionable single-cell interpretation requires simultaneous access to:
- 44+ cell type definitions with canonical marker genes
- 12 cancer-specific TME reference profiles
- 30+ drug sensitivity databases
- Spatial transcriptomics platform specifications
- Active clinical trial registries
- 75+ validated marker gene associations

No single analyst maintains current expertise across all these domains.

## 3. Solution Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Design

The agent follows the **Plan-Search-Evaluate-Synthesize-Report** pattern:

1. **Plan:** Parse the query, classify the workflow type (1 of 11), and construct a search plan with collection-specific weights
2. **Search:** Execute parallel vector searches across 12 Milvus collections using BGE-small-en-v1.5 embeddings
3. **Evaluate:** Score evidence quality, check cross-collection corroboration, assess clinical relevance
4. **Synthesize:** Generate a grounded LLM response using Claude Sonnet with retrieved evidence
5. **Report:** Format structured output with citations, severity levels, and actionable recommendations

### 3.2 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 12 separate collections (not 1 monolithic) | Workflow-specific weight boosting, schema optimization per data type |
| BGE-small-en-v1.5 (384-dim) | Balance of quality and speed; 384-dim sufficient for biomedical text |
| IVF_FLAT index | Simple, accurate, adequate for < 100K records per collection |
| Pydantic models for all I/O | Type safety, validation, auto-documentation |
| 4 dedicated decision engines | Deterministic clinical logic separate from LLM stochasticity |
| Graceful degradation | Each component failure reduces capability, never crashes |
| COSINE similarity | Standard for normalized text embeddings |

### 3.3 What This Agent Does NOT Do

- Does not process raw FASTQ/BAM files (that is the genomics pipeline)
- Does not perform de novo clustering or dimensionality reduction (that is the computational pipeline)
- Does not store patient health records (no PHI storage)
- Does not replace pathologist review (decision support, not decision making)
- Does not run GPU-accelerated analysis (v1.0 -- RAPIDS integration planned for v2.0)
